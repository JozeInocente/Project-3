Pixels vs Art

# Project Overview
#### Pixels vs Art is an event aimed to bring awareness towards the conditions of the digital art industry. Since the boom of AI learning, there has been many issues pertaining to intellectual properly and ensuring that artist's are respected in a rapidly changing digital industry. This AI learning uses artwork from various artists, often without consent, harming the personal and unique style of these artists, by distributing it without any sort of compensation or credit. Awareness is the best way to make a difference, if artists know more about how to protect their artwork, then it will be much harder for their art to be stolen. We are partnering with "The Glaze Project" which is essentially a tool created by researchers in Chicago to help artists protect their work from being copied by AI programs.
# Technical Overview
#### The event website aims to communicate information in a simple but stylish approach. We want the brand to come forward as professional but also welcoming. We created a clean look and duo tone color palette with type being the main focus, it fills most of the screen and the single line of color works as an accent that gives it a more unique look to the entire website. Using the color orange allows us to communicate a warm and welcoming feeling but also the accent bring in the modern aspect to show that our topic relates to technology and the impact of it.
